# SunTzuGenerator

_You have something to say but don't want to put it out there, let the wise Sun Tzu speak._

### Where did the idea come from?

Thanks to my friend Yasin I came into contact with this trend of making fake quotes under videos that list Sun Tzu's quotes, author of the famous military strategy book _The Art Of War_. During a hectic night we created so many quotes that we didn't have time to translate them into stickers to use without having to remember the whole quote. From this problem was born this Telegram bot that you can easily adjust for your purposes.

### Who is this code for?

The code is published because it might be useful to have a Telegram bot to help us, in case you want to implement one, this is a tip you might want to look at. If, however, you don't know where to put your hands, I recommend you use the keyboard and start typing new quotes signed "Sun Tzu"!

### Commands and Messages

Currently the bot has one command and two types of messages that can be translated into the command to generate a 512x512px image which will then be converted and installed as a Telegram sticker.
* The `/start` command starts the bot.
* All messages of the type `"<citation>" cit. <name-of-author> Tzu` (`<name>` can be omitted) or with the final addition of `, <name-of-book>` are interpreted by the bot as commands to generate a sticker with the quote.
